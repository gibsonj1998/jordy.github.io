## Welcome to Jordy's Portfolio and Knowledge Share

I hope to bring lots of great content to you in the fields of IT networking and the cloud with a focus in the Azure Ecosystem.

This site will also showcase some of my personal projects and experience throughout my IT career. 

### Configure Macbook Air w/ M1 Chip as a P2S Client with Azure Virtual Network Gateway

I get the chance to work with a lot of IT professionals that take advantage of the Point-to-Site VPN offering on the Azure Virtual Network Gateway to connect their remote users into their Azure Virtual Networks. And a lot of the time these remote end-users are working with MacOS, which can be scary for some of our native Microsoft Administrators.

While helping these clients configure their point-to-site VPNs for their remote users we can run into some issues. So as I recently acquired Apple's new M1 MacBook Air, I thought it appropriate to go through the process of setting up the machine as a client on my Azure VPN and see if I am able to reach the resources in my Virtual Network.

REQUIREMENTS

# The P2S VPN will use a certificate generated in PowerShell on a Windows Machine.

- M1 MacBook Air running MacOS Big Sur (v11.5.2)
- Root and Child Certificate w/ full chain
 Azure Resources:
- Azure Virtual Network 
- Azure VM for connectivity testing
- Azure Virtual Network Gateway (Non-Basic SKU)

```
# Provisioning Azure Resources
Start by configuring the Azure Virtual Network Gateway as a P2S VPN. This can be done in the portal using the following steps:
1. Go to the Azure Portal and at the top search for "Virtual Network Gateway" and then click "Create"
2. You will then be prompted to configure the actual gateway itself.
