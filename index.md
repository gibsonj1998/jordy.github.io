## Welcome to Jordy's Portfolio and Knowledge Share

I hope to bring lots of great content to you in the fields of IT networking and the cloud with a focus in the Azure Ecosystem.

This site will also showcase some of my personal projects and experience throughout my IT career. 

### Configure Macbook Air w/ M1 Chip as a P2S Client with Azure Virtual Network Gateway

I get the chance to work with a lot of IT professionals that take advantage of the Point-to-Site VPN offering on the Azure Virtual Network Gateway to connect their remote users into their Azure Virtual Networks. And a lot of the time these remote end-users are working with MacOS, which can be scary for some of our native Microsoft Administrators.

While helping these clients configure their point-to-site VPNs for their remote users we can run into some issues. So as I recently acquired Apple's new M1 MacBook Air, I thought it appropriate to go through the process of setting up the machine as a client on my Azure VPN and see if I am able to reach the resources in my Virtual Network.
