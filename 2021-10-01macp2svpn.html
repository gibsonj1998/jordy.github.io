                    <!--Intro Section of Article-->
                    <p>
                        I get the chance to work with a lot of IT professionals that take advantage of the Point-to-Site VPN offering 
                        on the Azure Virtual Network Gateway to connect their remote users into their Azure Virtual Networks. And a 
                        lot of the time these remote end-users are working with MacOS, which can be scary for some of our native Microsoft 
                        Administrators.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While helping these clients configure their point-to-site VPNs for their remote users we can run into some issues. 
                        So as I recently acquired Apple's new M1 MacBook Air, I thought it appropriate to go through the process of setting 
                        up the machine as a client on my Azure VPN and see if I am able to reach the resources in my Virtual Network. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <!--Requirements List-->
                    <h4>Requirements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>M1 MacBook Air running MacOS Big Sur (v11.5.2)</li>
                        <li>Root and Child Certificate w/ full chain</li>
                        <li>Azure Virtual Network</li>
                        <li>Azure Virtual Network Gateway (Non-Basic SKU)</li>

                    </ul>
        
                    <!--Provision the azure resources-->
        
                    <h4>Provision the Azure Resources</h4>
                    <p>
                        Start by configuring the Azure Virtual Network Gateway as a P2S VPN. 
                        This can be done in the portal using the following steps:
                        <br>
                        1. Go to the Azure Portal and at the top search for "Virtual Network Gateway" and then click "Create"
                        <br>
                        2. You will then be prompted to configure the actual gateway itself.

                        <br>
                        Note: Deploying this resource can take up to 50 minutes to complete.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. Once the resource deployment has completed. Navigate to the blade for your new Azure VNG and 
                        click on the "Point-to-Site Configuration" tab under "Settings".
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/configp2s.png" alt="Configure P2S VPN settings" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        <b>Address Pool: </b>The IP address range that P2S Clients will retrieve addresses from. 
                        <br>
                        <b>Tunnel Type:</b> This will be the type of Secure tunnel you want to create. When using MacOS Devices 
                        as P2S clients, IKEv2 must be selected. 
                        <br>
                        <b>Authentication Type:</b> How you want the clients to be able to authenticate with the Azure P2S VPN. 
                        In this case, we are using a self-signed certificate. 
                        <br>
                        <b>Root Certificates:</b> Here we will paste the actual root certificate data into Azure so that the gateway can 
                        talk to clients using the certificate for authentication. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <i>If you do not already have a certificate and want to learn more about configuring your own, please click <a href="#">here.</a> </i>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4. Once the above settings have been configured, click "Save" at the top of the blade and then once that is complete,
                        click "Download VPN Client" and then make that downloaded zip accessible to your MacBook Air device. Alternatively you
                        could download this directly onto the MAC by navigating to the portal from that machine. The file we will be dealing 
                        with from the downloaded zip folder will be the "generic" VPN config file which will contain the FQDN for the VPN server. 
                    </p>
        
                    <h4>Configuring the M1 MacBook Air as a P2S Client</h4>
                    <p>
                        1. First we will want to verify that we have the certificate that we need on our M1 MacBook Air. Upon booting the machine, 
                        navigate to the "Keychain Access" application and then click on "Certificates" 
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/grabcert.png" alt="Obtain the client cert" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        There you should be able to see your Child cert that you imported onto the machine. Instructions for importing the cert can 
                        be found <a href="#">here</a>, as well as how to obtain the cert in the first place.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Once the cert is located, open up the "Finder" Application and locate the location of your VPN config folder that was 
                        downloaded from the portal. Navigate to the file w/ the title "Generic", and in the XML find the value for the "VPN Server". 
                        This will be the FQDN of the VPN that we will use to connect. 
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/obtaingwurl.png" alt="get the VPN Server URL" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        3. Once the above information has been collected we can navigate to our "Network Preferences" in the top right of the menu bar 
                        on our Mac.
                        <br>
                        4. Once in th network preferences, you may need to add a new interface of type, VPN. Then Select "VPN" for the interface, "IKEv2" 
                        for the VPN Type, and then provide a name for the VPN connection and click "Create".
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/addvpnint.png" alt="Configure the VPN interface in the Network settings" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        Once the new VPN interface is created, we can populate the connection with our values. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        5. The "Server Address" and the "Remote ID" are going to be the VPN Server FQDN that we were able to collect from the generic VPN 
                        config file. Once you have those copied in, then click on "Authentication Settings".
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/configintsettings.png" alt="Configure the VPN interface settings" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        6. This will open the following window, select the Authentication Settings as "Certificate" and then click select and navigate 
                        to the location of your child cert and click "OK". If you are using an older version the instructions can be different. Microsoft
                        has documented these nuances <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-configuration-azure-cert#create-vpn-client-profile">here.</a>
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/authsettings.png" alt="configure the authentication settings for the VPN connection" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        7. Then populate the "Local ID" with the common name of the Certificate that you are using.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/localid.png" alt="Use the common name of the cert for the local ID in the VPN connection" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        8. CLick Connect!
                        <br>
                        You may be prompted for the machines user password, enter that in and then the window should change to show your status as Connected. 
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/connectedstatus.png" alt="Here you can see the details and status of the P2S connection" height=50% width=50% />
                        <br>
                        This shows how long you have been connected and what IP address was allocated from the P2S pool. You can further confirm 
                        this by navigating to your Azure Portal where you will be able to see the allocated IP addresses under the Point-to-Site 
                        configuration tab on the Virtual Network Gateway.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your P2S VPN and client are now functional. You can also check in the Azure portal to see that the Azure Virtual Network 
                        Gateway is tracking your new user.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                    </p>
        
                    <h4>Test connectivity to the Azure Virtual Network from the P2S Client. </h4>
                    <p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: none;padding:1%;">
                            <li>1. Now that we have confirmed that we are connected to the Azure P2S VPN, we need to be sure that we can actually 
                                reach our other resources in the Virtual Network. 
                            </li>
                            <li>2. To test, I have spun up a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure and will attempt to send an ICMP echo against it. </li>
